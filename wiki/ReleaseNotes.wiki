Release notes:

* 1.0.0-alpha4 (2013.10.24)

New features:

For the first time plugin was tested with independent Play! modules: Deadbolt and SecureSocial. It works!

Changes:

- [http://code.google.com/p/play2-maven-plugin/issues/detail?id=11 Issue 11] remove tricky "mainLang" autodetection mechanism. "scala" is not default "mainLang" value. If you need "java", you have to add <mainLang>java</mainLang> to plugin's configuration section.

* 1.0.0-alpha3 (2013.10.21)

New features:

- [http://code.google.com/p/play2-maven-plugin/issues/detail?id=7 Issue 7] Play! 2.1.x and 2.2.x support.

Fixed:

- [http://code.google.com/p/play2-maven-plugin/issues/detail?id=8 Issue 8] - fix bug in "start" script generated by "dist" mojo

- [http://code.google.com/p/play2-maven-plugin/issues/detail?id=9 Issue 9] - add "mainLang" configuration parameter to avoid autodetection

- [http://code.google.com/p/play2-maven-plugin/issues/detail?id=10 Issue 10] - add "scalacOptions" and "javacOptions" configuration parameters

* 1.0.0-alpha2 (2013.09.20)

Fixed:

- [http://code.google.com/p/play2-maven-plugin/issues/detail?id=2 Issue 2] - configurable source encoding ("-encoding" option added to javac and scalac compilers) and full debug information in compiled classes ("-g" option added to javac compiler)
